//reason for shadow database - heroku's free postgres - the user heroku creates for that database does not have permission to create
// another database on that postgres instance, prisma needs the ability to create a db on the fly when it runs a migration
//but because heroku doesn't allow that, prisma fails, so as a workaround prisma allows us to have 1 db where we store the data
//and another one for the shadow
